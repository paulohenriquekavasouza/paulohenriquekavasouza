### I'm Paulo Henrique, hey! I'm based in Curitiba, Brazil. 🇧🇷

Since 2020, I work as Angular front-end developer. Since then I've learned so many new and exciting things about this world. Everyday I breath TypeScript.

I serve as the leader of our development team, where I guide and support the team through all aspects of the development process. This role involves key responsibilities to ensure our team performs at its highest potential.  

My tasks include overseeing the team's work, providing guidance, and maintaining quality standards through code reviews, pull request management, and task delivery coordination. I focus on fostering collaboration and a cohesive work environment.  

I translate Product Owner (PO) prototypes into functional application screens for dental healthcare and clinics. My technical expertise includes Angular (up to v15) and Angular Material, along with Azure DevOps integration for continuous delivery.  

I actively participate in daily team meetings to track progress, discuss prototypes, and align tasks with objectives. This ensures focus and commitment to our goals and deliverables.

### What I've been working on 🖥️

Currently, improving my skills with Angular and learning so much more about the framework and its power. 💥
