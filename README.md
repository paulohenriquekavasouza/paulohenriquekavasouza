### I'm Paulo Henrique, hey! I'm based in Curitiba, Brazil. 🇧🇷

Since 2020, I work as Angular front-end developer. Since then I've learned so many new and exciting things about this world. Everyday I breath TypeScript.

I've started my carreer back in 2015 with C# and VB.net, but I've been programming since I was 14. I saw this new kind of applications built around reactive web pages
and in 2020 decided to take some risks and full migrate from flat PHP to Angular (front-end) and Laravel (back-end). I started learning about Angular and was wondered with the
world I was seeing.

Since then I've never wanted to go back. In April of 2021 I gave a huge step to my carreer again, switching from full-stack to front-end.

### What I've been working on 🖥️

Currently, improving my skills with Angular and learning so much more about the framework and its power. 💥
